# Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistance shows plasmids that have a certain type of antibiotic 
resistance. Although this is also a browsing feature it is separated from the
 remaining, because these are key in plasmid classification and in antibiotic
  resistance finding.

## Plasmid types

Plasmid types classify plasmids using a classical plasmid classification 
system from PlasmidFinder (**citation still missing**).

## Resistances

Resistances highlight plasmids with the selected resistances by the user.

**NOTE: None of these two functions are yet implemented in the stable version 
of pATLAS. Please be patience.**
