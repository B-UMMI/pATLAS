# Antibiotic and plasmid family detection

Antibiotic resistance was detected using [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate). 
To do so, we used three databases available in Abricate. Two (card and 
resfinder) were used to search for plasmids that contained certain antibiotic
 resistance while the third one was used to characterize plasmid families 
 (plasmidfinder). This approach provide the user with a fully comprehensive 
 characterization of antibiotic resistance genes in the plasmids present in 
 the NCBI database. And also for those that are interested in plasmid 
 families, it is also possible to quickly visualize a certain family of 
 interest.
