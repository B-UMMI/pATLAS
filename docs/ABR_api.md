# Antibiotic and plasmid family detection

Antibiotic resistance was detected using [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) 
with three databases: card and resfinder were used to search for plasmids 
that contained certain antibiotic resistance genes, plasmidfinder to
to characterize plasmid families and vfdb to annotate virulence genes
in each plasmid.

This approach provide the user with a
fully comprehensive characterization of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in
the plasmids present in the NCBI database, as well as a quick way to
visualize a certain family of interest.
