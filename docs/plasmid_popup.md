This popup also features a button at the top left corner that allows to
export all displayed data into a csv file that can be imported in any
spreadsheet.

* Virulence genes

This chart is interactive and you may **zoom in** (by dragging the mouse
while holding left mouse button) and use a sliding window (by pressing `ctrl`
key and dragging the left mouse button).
