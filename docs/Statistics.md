# Statistics

Plasmid Atlas provides the user with many capabilities in what concerns the 
visualization of the distribution of the results. For instance users may 
visualize the number of plasmids that belong were described in a given 
**species**, **genus**, **family** and **order**. And you have many more 
options available but the idea is for the user to perform a given selection 
either with the area selection tool (shift + mouse click and dragging) or 
with the filters / imports (in fact any node that has color will be taken 
into account for statistics module). 

> Because pATLAS can't know for the user which plasmids you are interested 
in, the user must be aware of the selection that has been performed. So, if 
you are unsure of the selection that you have made user the **reset nodes** 
button and make your selection from start.
