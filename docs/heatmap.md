# Heatmap

The heatmap is used in combination with the imports from mapping or
mash screen (for further details in [Import](Import.md). The heatmap 
button is available once selection is made (available in the top 
navigation bar) and will show results if import files from mapping, 
mash screen or sequence JSON files are provided.
This feature allows the same exports as the
[plots for Statistics](Statistics.md#plot-additional-buttons).

#### Example
This heatmap allows users to quickly see the plasmids present in two
different sets of reads:
