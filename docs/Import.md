# Import

Import functions allow the users to import a json file (or multiple files) generated by auxiliary
 scripts. These `JSON` files should contain sets of keys that make a
 correspondence between the accession numbers and the results of this 
 auxiliary script as the value of that accession number key.

**However, this is achieved by running auxiliary scripts, detailed on
each specific section.**

## Mapping results

This `JSON` file allows the user to visualize the coverage of mapping results,
displaying which plasmids are more likely to be in the set of reads of interest.

### Download and install

* First install [bowtie2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/) (v2.2.9 or higher) and
[samtools](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/) (v.1.3.1 or
higher).

* Second, download the [latest release](https://github.com/tiagofilipe12/PlasmidCoverage/releases/tag/v1.0.0) of this script
(don't forget to download [indexes folder](https://github.com/tiagofilipe12/PlasmidCoverage/releases/download/v1.0.0/indexes.tar.gz))

* Then, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

* Finally, uncompress the `indexes.tar.gz` file.

### How to run

`PlasmidUNCover.py -idx <path/to/indexes_folder> -r <path/to/reads_folder> -t 1 -o test -c 0.6`

### Importing in pATLAS

After, the run of the script has finished you should have a `JSON` file
(extension `.json`), which can be provided to pATLAS in the specific menu.

## Mash screen results

### Download and install

* Download [release 1.0.0 - popcorns & unicorns](https://github.com/tiagofilipe12/mash_wrapper/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
(don't forget to download [index file](https://github.com/tiagofilipe12/mash_wrapper/releases/download/v1.0.0/assembly_reference.msh),
that is used to run this script).

* Download [mash 2.0.0](https://github.com/marbl/Mash/releases/tag/v2.0)

-t <number_of_threads> -j -ms`

### Importing in pATLAS

After, the run of the script has finished you should have a `JSON` file
(extension `.json`), which can be provided to pATLAS in the specific menu.
