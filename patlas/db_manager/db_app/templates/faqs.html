              <p>pATLAS uses NCBI refseq database and therefore only
                plasmid sequences that are present in this database are
                represented in this network. Plasmids in other databases
                such as the 'nucleotide' or even European nucleotide archive
                may be absent from pATLAS.</p>
              <p>However, You can open an <a class="github-button"

              <p>This means that the shared part of their sequences
                have at least 90%
                average nucleotide identity (mash distance of 0.1 or less).
              <p>On the one hand, this gives an idea of the modularity of some
                components that compose plasmids, i.e., some small modules
                can be very easily integrated by larger plasmids. On the other
                hand, this may be odd when looking for similar plasmids and
                thus we implemented an option that allows to filter these
                differences in sequence size between pairs of plasmids. This
                option can be accessed through the
                left side menu, by selecting 'size ratio'.</p>
